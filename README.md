## Organization Structure. 
## Project Objectives. 

The main objective of this project is to create an automated, integrated 
system that will optimize Techmate-Total IT Solutions’ operational 
procedures. Critical operations, including product management, order 
management, supplier management and employee management are 
currently handled by the organization manually using document-based 
systems. The inefficiencies, time-consuming and high error rate of these 
manual processes constrain the company’s capacity to expand its 
operations efficiently.   
The proposed system will automate the key functions including inventory 
tracking, invoicing, and supplier database. The project aims to increase 
productivity, reduce the administrative load on staff and improve accuracy 
by replacing the current Excel-based system. In the end this will put the 
organization in a growth-oriented position by allowing it to more efficiently 
manage its resources, serve customers more effectively and respond to the 
increasing demand of its expanding business. 
## Proposed Solution.

Due to the inefficiency and unreliability of Current Operations in 
Organization we have been asked to design an automated inventory and 
customer management system with a point of sales system for the Techmate
Total IT Solutions.  
Managing inventory, orders, suppliers, employees and customers are 
crucial tasks when it comes  to a selling and distributing company like 
Techmate-Total IT Solutions. All the records should be stored in a database 
to manage them more accurately. With this automated system things can be made easier to manage by providing the ability to store all data in a 
database through user-friendly interfaces.  
In our proposed software solution these are the functional and 
nonfunctional requirements that can be recommended for the issues and 
problems that were stated previously.  


## 1. Functional requirements 

• Automated inventory management system  
1. Add new items  
o When purchasing orders workers can simply enter the details of a product as in the 
product name, price and quantity. Product id is automatically assigned, and the 
inventory will automatically be updated. 

2. Search item details  
o Search function helps to find any item that is needed to add to cart, update or 
remove. 
o When an item needed to be removed or the product details needed to be changed, 
they can be done through the system more easily and efficiently, 

3. Update item details  
o Product details can be updated easily through the system. Updated details 
will be stored automatically in the database.  

4. Remove items  
o Any product can be removed easily through the system. The product details 
will be removed automatically from the database. 

5. Track inventory level  
o Employees can easily view and manage inventory through the system.  
o Since this method provides real time updates, stockouts or overstocking 
problems no longer occurred.  

6. Create quotation  
o Salesperson can create quotations for the customers as their 
requirement through the system more efficiently.        
o Creation of quotation will not affect the inventory as the item is not sold at 
that current moment.  

• Order Management  

1. process sales  
o When selling products, all the product details can be searched and 
viewed easily through the system  
o When placing an order, the salesperson needs only to log into the system and 
choose items and the quantity. Other details of the products will be filled out 
automatically according to the data which is stored in the database.  
o Inventory will be automatically updated after the selling process.  

2. Apply discounts  
o Salesperson should be able to apply discounts to the item itself or to the 
whole invoice.   
o Salesperson should be able to decide whether the discount is given by rate or by 
amount.  

3. Calculating bill amount  
o After confirming the order, according to the products and the quantity 
the bill amount is calculated automatically.  
o Since all calculations are automated, room for errors has been reduced and 
efficiency, reliability and useability has been increased. 

4. print invoice  
o After calculating the bill amount, the invoice is issued to the customer 
through the system. Time and date are also being tracked and stored 
on the database.  

• Supplier and Customer Management  

1. Register Supplier/Customer  
o The registration process has been made easier by the new automated 
system. Workers can enter supplier or customer details into the system, 
and it will store the details in the database. Supplier id or customer id 
will be generated automatically.     

2. Search Supplier/Customer  
o For refer any supplier or customer details workers can search and find a 
specific supplier or customer with no time with the search function that 
is provided with the system.  

3. Update details  
o Updating supplier/customer details is much easier than the previous 
manual process, with the search function which is included in the 
automated management system.  

4. Remove Supplier/Customer  
o Any supplier or customer who is no longer required to be saved in the 
system can be removed easily with their details.  

• Employee Management  

1. Register Employee  

2. Search for Employee  

3. Update Employee  

4. Remove Employee  
o Same as supplier management, Employees and customers can be also 
manage easily and efficiently through the automated system.  
• Payroll system 
o In this proposed system it is possible to calculate the amount of salary for an 
employee according to the number of leaves and half days they have taken. 
Furthermore, adding a bonus to each employee has become a possible scenario 
with the presence of this payroll system.  
• Report generation  
o Only admin will be able to generate reports. Admin should be able to generate 
order reports, inventory reports, customer reports, financial reports and service 
reports.  
o Since inventory and customer management systems are linked with the 
database, searching for details for report generation is not an issue. Hence 
report generation can be done very efficiently without any errors.   

• Creating job notes  

o Technicians should be able to create job notes. With a description of the 
service, they are providing.  
•  Creating quotation   
o Salesperson has the ability to create a quotation that provides customers with 
the necessary information they need before placing an order.  
## 2. Non-Functional requirements  
1. Usability   
o The inventory and customer management system comes with a user-friendly 
interface that workers can easily navigate through the system and get the job done.   

2. Performance   
o Solve the problem of time consumption and inefficacy by making work faster and 
easier.   
o The system interfaces will open in less than 1 second and the operations of saving 
details, editing records and making calculations can be done in no time.   

3. Reliability  
o The probability of system down time is very low. Even if the software crashes or 
freezes due to an unavoidable reason the data will not be lost or damaged.  
o Since the probability of error occurring is being reduced, the system is more 
reliable than entering details and calculating bill amounts manually.  

4. Security   
o Since the system is password protected only authorized users can view or change 
details. This prevents all unauthorized access to the system.  
o In the meantime, the sensitive data which is stored in the database is encrypted 
and protected providing a more secure service.  

5. Scalability  
o Increasing the number of employees is a possible scenario. In this case the system 
should be able to operate without degrading its performance in increased number 
of devices.    

6. Maintainability  
o Changes and updates should be easily made to the system if an error occurs, or 
any updates are needed.  

7. Data integrity  
o The possibility of data corruption and data loss is prevented through the system 
providing data accuracy and consistency     

8. Compatibility  
o The system should be compatible with any operating systems and devices such as 
personal computers and laptops.  
Recommending these solutions through an automated inventory and 
customer management system, it is expected to solve the problems with the 
current process and provide more reliable, efficient and secure procedure to 
enhance overall business performance and customer satisfaction.     

8. Chapter Summery. 
Techmate – Total IT solutions company is a small-scale IT service 
providing company which  mainly sales computer components and 
security components while repairing them.  
The company currently manages their records and details manually using 
Microsoft office. As a result of this manual process, services and 
management are inefficient and unreliable. Due to the problems they had 
to face, an automated inventory and customer management system is 
proposed.  
## 2 Chapter 2: Methodology 
## 1. Introduction 

The methodology chapter outlines the techniques and technical approaches that will 
be used in order to achieve the project objectives. The methodology used is a 
systematic approach which will make sure the project will be implemented 
efficiently and successfully. 

Main levels of project methodology  

o Initiation of project:   Objective of this step is to identify and learn project 
scope, business stakeholders. In this step the team will conduct the initial 
meeting with stakeholders and understand the main deliverables that need 
to be delivered by the project.  

o Requirement Gathering:   In this level team will use methods such as record 
reviews, conduct meetings, conduct questionaries to gather required 
information from stakeholders.   

o Planning the solution: Team members use this phase to create a plan/ 
blueprint of the software that need to be designed, ensuring it meets the 
customers’ requirements.   

o Development of solution: In this phase the actual software will be designed 
according to the plans made.  

o Software testing and QA: Software will be tested against expected results 
in user requirements and tested for any bugs and flaws. 
## 2. Data Collection Method(s)

Data collection is a process of gathering customer needs using different 
strategies to collect clear, reliable and trustworthy information.   
Below are the information gathering methods we used throughout the project. 

o Interviews 
o Referring existing documents  
o Site visiting  

1. Interviews  
Ensuring customer satisfaction consists of the process of making sure that the 
needs of every user who using the system is fulfilled in the end of the 
development. In-person meetings are a good method to gather the needs of 
each user in depth.  

2. Referring existing documents  
To create a new automated system, studying how the current manual system 
handles business tasks is crucial. Below are some documents we referred to 
building a complete understanding of the system.  

o Invoice samples  
o Job notes samples  
o Invoice related excel sheets  

3. Site visiting  
Visiting the site was very crucial to fully understand how users will interact 
with the system on a day-to-day basis.   


## 3. Software Process Model 

The incremental model is being used for the development of this system. Rather 
than developing in a single, massive cycle, this model allows the system to be 
designed, developed and implemented in smaller, more manageable steps. Each 
increment provides a working module of the system, allowing the organization to 
take advantage of core functionalities early while adding additional features.  
The incremental model ensures that any modification or enhancements can be made 
effectively all the way through the development process. This method lowers risk, 
increases adaptability and provides that the system improves according to the 
organization’s developing requirements.  
Selecting the incremental model as our development model offers numerous 
advantages.  

o Early Delivery of key features: the incremental model makes it possible to 
develop and deploy the system’s essential features earlier than the schedule, 
giving the company access to it before the entire system is delivered.  

o Flexibility and Adaptability: During the project, the model’s ability to adjust in 
following increments in response to input or changing business requirements 
improves adaptability. 

o Improve Testing and Debugging: Before going to the next stage, every 
increment is carefully tased. By ensuring that problems are found and fixed in 
small stages, this enhances the overall stability of the system.  

o User feedback: After every release, Organization can offer feedback to make 
sure the system is meeting the needs and objectives of the company.  
## 4. Software Development Tools 
Developing modern software solution requires setting up developing 
environment and use of specific toolsets.  
To design our proposed solution we will utilize software development toolkits 
and support services mentioned below.  

• UI design tool   
o Figma is a web-based interface designing platform. It was used to 
design User-Interfaces before implementing them through the end 
product.   

• Version Controlling  
o GitHub was used for version controlling and mange changes 
within the development process in order to deliver a quality 
software product.  

• Programming Languages   

• C# 

o According to the later discussions, C# was decided to use as the 
programing language altering the decision to use java. 
o C# supports object-oriented programming (OOP) principles such 
as encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism, making it 
easier to create modular and maintainable code.
o C# is the programing language used in this project according to 
fulfill its functionalities and requirements withing the given 
deadlines. 

• SQL 
o SQL language will be used as the data manipulating language which 
will control the behavior of database according to controls of designed 
software 

• Code editors  
o IntelliJ J idea community edition offered by JetBrains foundation was 
planning to use as primary code editor and designer for the 
development process. 
o As the team decided to implement the system using C# instead of Java, 
the decisions made regarding the primary code editor have been 
changed. 
o Visual Studio offered by Microsoft is the primary IDE for C# 
development, offering a rich set of tools and features to streamline the 
development process. 
o According to the later discussions, Microsoft Visual Studio 
Community 2022 (64-bit) –  17.11.2 was used as primary code editor 
and designer for the development process. 

• Reports generators  
o Crystal Reports for .NET Framework, Service pack 33, Developer 
version was used to create Reports that is needed to generate through 
the system as in bills, invoices and sales reports. 
## 5. Testing Strategies

Software testing is a crucial event of the software development life cycle. It 
is the process of executing a system to find bugs and errors in the Software, 
to get them fixed.  
It ensures the quality of the system while improving its functionalities both 
functional and non-functional.   
The types of testing strategies that are decided to use in this software testing process 
are mentioned below.  

• Functional Requirements Testing  

1. Unit Testing   
Unite testing can be used to test system components or functions 
individually. Errors and bugs can be uniquely identified for each unit. It 
can be used to fix errors and improve the quality of service for each 
function separately.  

2. System Testing  
System testing is a black box type testing that is based on overall 
requirement specifications that covers the entire system for finding and 
fixing bugs and errors.   

3. Acceptance (Alpha) Testing  
Testing the system to identify all the possible errors and bugs before it 
is released to the real environment. Performed in a development 
environment.  

• Non-Functional Requirements Testing  

1. Performance Testing  
Check whether the system meets the required performance. By testing 
it under various conditions.  

2. Security Testing 
Check whether the software can be breached by any unauthorized 
access and how it will react to any malicious programs and viruses.  

3. Compatibility Testing  
Testing how the software runs on different operating systems.   

4. Exhausting Testing  
Testing all the possible data combinations by giving all the types of 
software inputs to check the outputs. It ensures that the system will not 
crash in any situation.   
## 6. Implementation Plan

Objectives and Goals  
During the implementation, the primary goal is to make sure the new system is 
configured and functions properly, scarifying the goals of the organization. This involves 
configuring it for efficiency, ensuring that all features function properly and integrating 
it with current processes.  
Performing full testing while implementing is another key objective. This ensures 
that any possible problem is found and fixed quickly, and it is a secure system for 
long-term operation. To make sure the system stays effective as the company 
grows.  
Timeline and Milestones  
A successful project needs a set of well-planned timelines and milestones to achieve 
targets. This milestone outlines the key stages of project goals. The milestones we 
planned in the project life cycle are stated below.  

Phase 1: Planning  
Week1: Initial planning of project   
Week 2-4: Requirement Gathering 

Phase 2: Design  
Week 5-6: UI design/ Documentation  
Week 7-11: Technical Design and development/ Testing/ Documentation/   

Phase 3: Testing and Quality Assurance  
Week 11-12: System testing 

Approach method  
There are four usable methods when converting to a new system from a legacy system. 
Parallel running has been decided for use in this transition.   
Hence the old manual system and the new automated inventory and customer 
management system can operate simultaneously until all the tests are done and 
make sure the program is running without any errors.  
During this period, each output of the new system can be compared with the output 
of the old manual system.   
Following this approach method the amount of risk that can happen if the system 
fails or crashes will be reduced. 
## 7. Chapter Summery

This chapter describes the methodology and strategies used to carry out the 
project in a successful manner. The system will be delivered effectively and 
efficiently because of the structured plan that was selected.  
Project beginning, requirement collecting, planning and development are 
important phases. Site visits, document evaluations, and interviews were 
used to gather data. The software process model that was chosen was the
incremental model because of the flexibility and capacity to deliver 
essential functions ahead of schedule while taking user feedback.  
C# is the main programing language, SQL is the main database development 
tool and other software development tools including Figma, GitHub and 
Visual Studio were used. Stability, performance and security are tested using 
various methods including functional and nonfunctional.  
To guarantee a seamless setup of the system, a well-defined 
implementation plan was established. The old manual system will continue 
to function alongside the new automated system unit testing verifies that it 
is functioning properly. This approach lowers risks without affecting 
productivity.
